Creating WordPress pages should be fast & easy. [Brizy](https://brizy.io/) is a new and innovative way of building WordPress pages visually. No designer or developer skills required. The only tools you'll need to master are clicks and drags.

== Highlights ==

![Clutter free](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Clutter-free.gif)

= Smart & clutter free =
Most page builders crowd all the options for a specific element in remote sidebars, making it hard to focus on the task at hand. We show only what's needed, front & centre, close to the element you're editing.

![Drag & Drop](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Drag-Drop.gif)

= Intuitive drag & drop =
Moving content elements, columns or rows is a breeze with our intuitive Drag & Drop feature. Just grab and drag them to the desired position and everything will instantly fall into place.

![Design Elements](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Design-Elements.gif)

= Design elements =
Text, buttons, images, icons, video, maps and many more are ready to help you create your page design in a snap.

![Pre-made blocks](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pre-made-blocks.gif)

= Over 150 pre-made blocks =
Blocks are pre-made designs that you can add to your page, ready to be customised. This will enable you to create the main structure of your page in a matter of minutes, while also ensuring that it looks awesome.

![Icons](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Icons.gif)

= Over 4000 icons included =
Available in both Outline and Glyph versions, even the most demanding icon needs are covered. Quickly find the icons you're after by filtering through categories or searching by keywords.

![Global styling](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Global-styling.gif)

= Global styling =
Ever wanted to change all the similar colors in your web page with a single click? With Brizy, you can! Not only that, but you can change all texts that share the same properties in one go, as well.

![Mobile friendly](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mobile-friendly.gif)

= Mobile Friendly =
Switch instantly to Mobile View mode, where you can make changes that will only apply to this type of devices. This gives you the power to differentiate your page design and optimise for smaller screens.

![Text Editor](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Text-Editor.gif)

= Smart text editor =
Just click and type to edit all the texts in-place. Changing colors, fonts, alignments right there on the spot allows you to have a perfect representation of how the design will look like in the end.

![Resize columns](https://brizy.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Resize-columns.gif)

= Resize columns =
Resize columns by dragging the handle that appears in between, with percentage values displayed up top. The content inside will automatically adapt to the new size.

= Undo / Redo =
Don't worry if you make a mistake or delete something that you shouldn't have. With Undo you can get everything back.

= Cloud auto-save =
The progress you're making while building your page is always backed up in the cloud, so you'll never lose your work.
